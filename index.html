            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your
                files and collaborate with others. It is used to manage the history of your code and to merge changes
                from different branches. I can understand that as of now these terms like version control, branches, and
                merges are not familiar to you. But don’t worry, we will learn them in this tutorial.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-100 font-montserrat">Git and GitHub</h2>
            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-400">Git and GitHub are different</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to your
                files. It is a free and open-source software that is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Remember,
                GIT is a software and can be installed on your computer.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Github is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Github is an
                online platform that allows you to store and share your code with others. It is a popular platform for
                developers to collaborate on projects and to share code. It is not that Github is the only provider of
                Git repositories, but it is one of the most popular ones.</p>

        <!-- Version Control Section -->
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-100 font-montserrat">A Little on Version Control Systems</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Version control systems are used to manage the history of your code. They
                allow you to track changes to your files and to collaborate with others. Version control systems are
                essential for software development. Consider version control as a checkpoint in a game. You can move to
                any time in the game and you can always go back to the previous checkpoint. This is the same concept in
                software development.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Before Git became mainstream, version control systems were used by
                developers to manage their code. They were called SCCS (Source Code Control System). SCCS was a
                proprietary software that was used to manage the history of code. It was expensive and not very
                user-friendly. Git was created to replace SCCS and to make version control more accessible and
                user-friendly. Some common version control systems are Subversion (SVN), CVS, and Perforce.</p>

        <!-- Learning Path Section -->
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-100 font-montserrat">Learning Path</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of Git and Github. We will start
                with the basics and then move on to more advanced topics. We will also learn how to use Git and Github
                for collaboration and version control. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good understanding
                of Git and Github and will be able to use them to manage your code effectively.</p>
            <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-400">We will go on this journey something like this:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-400">
                <li>Get the basics</li>
                <li>Use it daily</li>
                <li>Face the problems</li>
                <li>Solve them</li>
                <li>Learn more</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">We will focus more on Git first, once you understand Git, moving towards
                Github will be easy.</p>

        <!-- Install Git Section -->
        <section>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-100 font-montserrat">Install Git</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">To install Git, you can use the command line or you can visit the official
                website and download the installer for your operating system. Git is available for Windows, macOS, and
                Linux and is available at <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"
                    class="text-blue-400">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-100 font-montserrat">Account on Github</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">Another step that you have to follow is to create an account on Github. I
                will later walk you through the process of linking your Github account with your Machine. You cannot
                push your code to Github without SSH-key setup. Password authentication is not recommended and these
                days it is not possible to use it. So, you need to set up SSH-key authentication. We will cover that in
                a later part of the tutorial.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-400">In this part, we have learned the basics of Git and Github. We have also
                learned how to install Git and Github. We have also learned about the importance of version control
                systems and how they are used in software development. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good
                understanding of Git and Github and will be able to use them to manage your code effectively.</p>
